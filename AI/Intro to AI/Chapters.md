1. Introduction
    What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

    AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These tasks range from understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI is a broad field with numerous subfields, each with its unique objectives and specializations. Check out our full guide, What is AI? to find out more. You can also explore how AI is different from machine learning in a separate article. 

    What are the different types of artificial intelligence?

    As AI grows in popularity, the technology is discussed in various ways. To simplify the remainder of the article, it’s important to look at the different types of AI. AI can be categorized into three levels based on its capabilities:

    Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): This is the most common form of AI we interact with today. ANI is designed to perform a single task, like voice recognition or recommendations on streaming services.
    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): An AI with AGI possesses the ability to understand, learn, adapt, and implement knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level. While large language models and tools such as ChatGPT have shown the ability to generalize across many tasks—as of 2023, this is still a theoretical concept.
    Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI): The final level of AI, ASI, refers to a future scenario where AI surpasses human intelligence in nearly all economically valuable work. This concept, while intriguing, remains largely speculative.

2. Intelligent Agents
    a. Agents
        - An agent is an entity that
            -> Perceives through sensors (eg. cameras, infrared sensors)
            -> Acts through effectors (eg. motors)
   
    b. Rational Agents
        - Rational Agent is one that does the right thing
        - Rational action is an action that maximises the expected value of an objective performance measure given the percept sequence
        - Rationality depends on the following:
            1. Performance measure
            2. Percept sequence
            3. Built-in knowledge of the environment
            4. Agent's range of actions
    
    c. Types of Environment
        - Accessible vs Inaccessible: Can the agent's sensors give it access to the full and complete state of the environment?
        - Deterministic vs Non-deterministic: Can the next state of action be determined by the current state and actions takes by the agent?
        - Episodic vs Sequential: Are the future states affected by previous states?
        - Static vs Dynamic: Does the environment change as the agent is perceiving and making a decision?
        - Discrete or Continuous: Affected by a single variable or multiple variables?
    
    d. Design of Problem-Solving Agent
    Problem-solving agents are intelligent entities that are capable of analyzing situation, identifying goals and devising effective strategies to achieve these goals. Designing these agents involves a structures approach that encompasses four key steps:
        1. Goal formulation - Clearly define the desired outcome, the specific objective tha the agent strives to attain
        2. Problem formulation - Construct a formal representation of the problem, specifying the initial state, permissible actions, and the conditions that indicate a successful solution
        3. Solution - Devising a sequence of legal actions, a step-by-step plan that guides the agent from the initial state to the desired goal state
        4. Search - Employing a search algorithm, a systematic procedure for exploring the space of possible actions and identifying an optimal or satisfactory solution

    Effectively designing problem-solving agents require careful consideration of these steps and the appropriate selection of search algorithm based on the agent's knowledge and the problem characteristics.

3. Search Algorithms
    Search algorithms are a fundamental component of artificial intelligence, enabling agents to navigate complex problem spaces and find solutions to challenging tasks. At the heart of search algorithms lie the concept of exploring the state space.

    - State Space
    The state space represents the collection of all possible configurations or situations that the agent can encounter in its environment. Each state is represented by a node in the state space, and the connections between nodes represent the possible actions that the agent can take to transition from one state to another.

    - Expanding Nodes
    The core operation of search algorithms is to expand nodes. Expanding a node involves generating its successors, which represent the new states that the agent can reach by taking a single action from the current node.

    - Frontier and Explored Set
    To maintain an organized search process, two data structures are commonly used:

    -> Frontier: The frontier, also known as the open set, is a collection of nodes that have been explored but not yet expanded. It represents the candidate nodes for expansion in the next iteration of the search algorithm.

    -> Explored Set: The explored set, also known as the closed set, is a collection of nodes that have already been expanded. It maintains a record of visited states to avoid revisiting them and ensure efficient exploration.

    There are multiple search strategies and a strategy is defined as the order of node expansion. Strategies can either be uninformed or informed. Strategies are evaluated using the following metrics:
        1. Completeness -> Is a solution found if it exists?
        2. Time complexity -> How long does it take?
        3. Space Complexity -> How much memory does it take?
        4. Optimal -> Is the solution found in the best (least-cost)?

    Uninformed Search Strats use only information available in the problem definition. 
        The following are some expamples of uninformed search strats:
        - Breadth-first search (BDS)
        - Uniform-cost search (UCS)
        - Depth-first search (DFS)
        - Iterative Deepending search (IDS)
    Uniformed search strategies are systematic in generating of new states but are inefficient (exponential space and time complexity)

    Informed Search strats use problem specific knowledge to guide the search and they are usually more efficient. 
        The following are some examples of informed search strats:
        - A-star Search / A* Search
        - Greedy BFS
    Informed search strategies use an evaluation function to estimate the "desirability" of each node. So what is this evaluation function?
    
    Evaluation function consists of path-cost function and a heuristic function.
        - Path-cost function g(n)
            -> Cost from initial state to current state n
            -> Information of the cost toward the goal is not required
        - Heuristic function h(n)
            -> Estimated cost of the cheapest pth from n to a goal state
                ~ Exact cost cannot be determined
            -> Depends only on the state at that node
            -> h(n) is not larger than the real cost (admissible)

    The various search strategies can also be categorised based on the mentioned evaluation metrics.

    1. Completeness:
        - Refers to the ability to guarantee to finding a solution if it exists. These algorithms will exhaustively explore the state space until a solution is found. The following are some examples of complete search strategies:
        a. BFS
        b. DFS
        c. A* Search with heuristic

    2. Time Complexity:
        - Refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to find a solution, typically represented in terms of the number of nodes generated/expanded. A search strategy with lower time complexity is more efficient and faster at finding solutions.
        The following are some examples of time-efficient strategies:
        a. A* strategies
        b. Greedy BFS
    
    3. Space Complexity:
        - Refers to the maximum amount of memory required by a search algorithm during execution. A search strategy with lower space complexity means it is more memory-efficient and can handle larger problem spaces. 
        The following are some examples of space-efficient strategies:
        a. DFS
    
    4. Optimality:
        - Refers to the ability to consistently find the best or least-cost solution to a problem. An optimal search algorithm guarantees that the solution found is the best possible solution.
        The following are some examples of optimal search strategies:
        a. A* search
        b. UCS
        c. IDS

    However, choosing a search algorithm is not that easy as there are trade-offs between search strategies. For instance, complete search algorithms like BFS and DFS are guaranteed to find a solution if one exists but may have high time and space complexity. Informed search algorithms like A* and Greedy Best-First Search can be more time and space efficient but may not always find the optimal solution.

    The choice of search strategy depends on the specific problem being solved and the desired balance between completeness, time complexity, space complexity, and optimality. In some cases, a trade-off may be necessary to achieve a balance between these factors.

4. Constraint Satisfaction
    What is Constraint Satisfaction?

    Constraint Satisfaction (CSP) is a fundamental concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research. It deals with finding a solution (assignment of values to variables) that satisfies a set of constraints. These constraints define which combinations of values for the variables are allowed.

    Components of a CSP:

    Variables: Entities that need to be assigned values.
    Domains: Set of possible values for each variable.
    Constraints: Rules that specify which combinations of values are allowed for different variables. These can be binary (between two variables) or n-ary (between more than two variables).
    Example:

    Variables: Colors for 4 houses (H1, H2, H3, H4)
    Domains: {Red, Green, Blue, Yellow}
    Constraints:
    No two adjacent houses can have the same color.
    H1 and H3 must be different colors.
    Solving CSPs:

    CSPs can be solved using various algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common algorithms include:

    Backtracking: Systematically explores the search space, backtracking when it reaches a dead end.
    Forward checking: Checks for future inconsistencies before assigning a value to a variable.
    Arc consistency: Propagates information about constraints to reduce the domains of variables.
    Constraint propagation: Applies various techniques to reduce the search space and improve efficiency.
    Applications of CSPs:

    Scheduling: Assigning tasks to resources, scheduling meetings, etc.
    Resource allocation: Distributing resources among competing tasks.
    Configuration: Finding valid configurations for hardware or software systems.
    Planning: Generating sequences of actions to achieve a goal.
    Games: Solving puzzles like Sudoku and crossword puzzles.

5. Markov Decision Process
    What is a Markov Decision Process (MDP)?

    A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations with sequential interactions, uncertainty, and rewards. It allows an agent to learn optimal behavior by taking actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for those actions.

    Components of an MDP:

    States: The possible configurations of the environment.
    Actions: The actions the agent can take in each state.
    Transition Probabilities: The probability of transitioning from one state to another after taking an action.
    Rewards: The immediate reward received for taking an action in a state.
    Discount Factor: A parameter that controls the importance of future rewards.
    Solving MDPs:

    MDPs can be solved using various algorithms to find the optimal policy (the mapping from states to actions that maximizes the expected long-term reward). Some common algorithms include:

    Value Iteration: Iteratively updates the state-value function (expected future reward starting from a state) until convergence.
    Policy Iteration: Evaluates the current policy and then improves it based on the state-value function.
    Q-Learning: A reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the expected future reward of taking an action in a state.
    Applications of MDPs:

    MDPs have a wide range of applications in AI and beyond, including:

    Robotics: Controlling robots to navigate in an environment and achieve goals.
    Game playing: Developing intelligent agents that can play games like chess and Go.

8. Logical Agent
    What are Logical Agents?

    Logical agents are a fundamental concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that represent an intelligent entity capable of reasoning and acting based on logical rules. They rely on a knowledge base and a set of inference rules to make decisions and achieve their goals in an environment.

9. Propositional Logic
    What is Propositional Logic?

    Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic, is a formal system for reasoning with truth values of statements. It uses logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to combine simple statements into complex ones and determines their truth values based on the truth values of the individual statements.

    Concepts of Propositional Logic:

    Propositions: Simple statements that are either true or false.
    Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, EQUIVALENCE, etc.
    Truth tables: Define the truth value of a complex statement based on the truth values of its constituent propositions and the applied logical operators.
    Inference rules: Rules that allow us to derive new propositions from existing ones.
    Propositions (P): Basic units of information that can be true or false.
    Connectives: Logical operators used to form compound propositions.
    Conjunction (AND): 
    P
    ∧
    Q
    P∧Q - True only if both 
    P
    P and 
    Q
    Q are true.
    Disjunction (OR): 
    P
    ∨
    Q
    P∨Q - True if at least one of 
    P
    P or 
    Q
    Q is true.
    Negation (NOT): 
    ¬
    P
    ¬P - True if 
    P
    P is false.
    Implication (IF-THEN): 
    P
    ⇒
    Q
    P⇒Q - True unless 
    P
    P is true and 
    Q
    Q is false.
    Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF): 
    P
    ⇔
    Q
    P⇔Q - True if 
    P
    P and 
    Q
    Q have the same truth value.

    Applications of Propositional Logic in AI:

    Knowledge representation: Representing facts about the world in a formal and unambiguous way.

10. First Order Logic

    What is First-Order Logic (FOL)?

    First-order logic (FOL), also known as predicate logic, is a powerful extension of propositional logic that allows us to represent and reason about objects and relationships between them. It uses variables, quantifiers, functions, and predicates to express complex relationships and knowledge about the world.

    Key Concepts of FOL:

    Variables: Represent objects or entities in the domain.
    Quantifiers: Universal (∀) and existential (∃) quantifiers specify whether a statement holds for all or some elements in the domain.
    Predicates: Represent properties of objects or relationships between them.
    Functions: Map objects to other objects.
    Terms: Variables, constants, or function applications.
    Formulas: Well-formed expressions built using terms, predicates, quantifiers, and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
    Applications of FOL in AI:

    Knowledge representation: Expressing facts and rules about the world, including relationships between objects and actions.
    Reasoning and planning: Deriving new knowledge from existing knowledge and planning sequences of actions to achieve goals.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding the meaning of sentences and generating text.
    Expert systems: Building systems that can provide expert-level advice in specific domains.
    Robotics: Reasoning about the environment and controlling robot actions.
    Benefits of Using FOL:

    Expressive power: Can represent a wide range of complex relationships and knowledge.
    Formalism: Provides a rigorous and well-defined framework for reasoning.
    Automatic reasoning: Algorithms exist for solving problems expressed in FOL.
    Example of FOL in AI:

    Representing the fact "John loves Mary" using the predicate Loves(John, Mary).
    Expressing the rule "All birds can fly" using the formula ∀x. Bird(x) → Flies(x).
    Reasoning about the world using inference rules like modus ponens and modus tollens.
    Planning a route for a robot to navigate through a maze using spatial reasoning and logical rules.

11. Default Logic

    What is Default Logic?

    Default logic, introduced by Raymond Reiter in 1980, is a non-monotonic logic that enables reasoning with incomplete information by making plausible assumptions. It extends classical logic by allowing the use of default rules, which represent typical or expected situations. These assumptions can be revoked if more specific information becomes available.

    Key Components of Default Logic:

    Default theory: A collection of propositional logic formulas and default rules.
    Default rule: Consists of a precondition, a justification, and a conclusion. The conclusion is assumed to hold unless there is evidence to the contrary (defeater).
    Extension: A set of propositions that logically follows from the default theory.
    Closure: A maximally consistent extension, meaning it contains all possible conclusions that can be derived from the default theory without violating any rules.
    Applications of Default Logic in AI:

    Reasoning about incomplete information: Filling in the gaps in knowledge and making plausible assumptions.
    Diagnosis and troubleshooting: Identifying the cause of a problem based on available evidence.
    Planning and decision-making: Choosing the most likely outcome or action in uncertain situations.
    Natural language processing: Understanding the meaning of sentences with ambiguous or missing information.
    Robotics: Reasoning about the environment and making decisions based on incomplete sensory data.
    Benefits of Using Default Logic:

    Flexibility: Allows for representing and reasoning with incomplete and uncertain information.
    Expressiveness: Provides a convenient way to express commonsense knowledge and default assumptions.
    Computability: Algorithms exist for computing extensions and closures of default theories.
    Example of Default Logic in AI:

    Diagnosing a disease: A default rule might state that "If a patient has a fever and cough, then they have the flu." This conclusion can be drawn unless there is evidence of another disease that explains the symptoms.
    Planning a route: A default rule might state that "If the road is clear, then the car will drive at the speed limit." This assumption can be violated if the car encounters traffic or other obstacles.
    Understanding a sentence: A default rule might state that "The subject of a sentence is usually the first noun." This helps in understanding who or what the sentence is about even when the subject is not explicitly mentioned.

This knowledge is valuable for various AI tasks, such as knowledge representation, reasoning, planning, and natural language processing, where dealing with uncertainties is unavoidable.

12. Fuzzy Logic

    What is Fuzzy Logic?

    Fuzzy logic is a mathematical framework for reasoning with vagueness and uncertainty. It differs from traditional binary logic (True/False) by allowing degrees of truth between 0 and 1. This enables modeling and reasoning about real-world phenomena that are inherently ambiguous or imprecise.

    Key Components of Fuzzy Logic:

    Fuzzy sets: Represent sets with gradual membership, unlike crisp sets with sharp boundaries.
    Membership functions: Define the degree to which an element belongs to a fuzzy set.
    Linguistic variables: Use natural language terms to express fuzzy sets and membership functions.
    Fuzzy rules: Encode expert knowledge or empirical data in the form of IF-THEN statements.
    Fuzzy inference engine: Applies fuzzy rules to input data and generates fuzzy outputs.
    Defuzzification: Converts fuzzy outputs into numerical values used for decision-making.
    Applications of Fuzzy Logic in AI:

    Control systems: Regulate complex systems with imprecise variables and non-linear dynamics.
    Expert systems: Provide expert-level advice and decision-making in various domains.
    Robotics: Control robot movement and interaction with the environment.
    Pattern recognition: Identify patterns in data with noise and uncertainties.
    Natural language processing: Understand and generate human language with its inherent ambiguity.
    Benefits of Using Fuzzy Logic:

    Human-like reasoning: Mimics human reasoning with imprecision and vagueness.
    Robustness to noise and uncertainty: Handles noisy data and uncertainties inherent in real-world systems.
    Flexibility and adaptability: Adapts to changing conditions and incomplete information.
    Example of Fuzzy Logic in AI:

    Controlling a washing machine: Fuzzy logic can be used to control the water temperature and washing cycle based on imprecise inputs like "light soil" or "heavily soiled."
    Medical diagnosis: A fuzzy expert system can analyze symptoms and diagnose diseases based on vague descriptions like "mild fever" or "severe pain."
    Autonomous vehicles: Fuzzy logic can help self-driving cars navigate roads and avoid obstacles even with limited sensor data and unforeseen situations.
